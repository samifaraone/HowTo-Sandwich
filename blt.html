		<h3> Fun facts </h3>
<p>
<br> 
	BLT (Bacon, Lettuce & Tomato)
<br>
<br>
	The abreviation 'BLT' first appeared in print during the early 1950s, but had already entered into common usage during the late 1940s.
<br>
<br>
	The BLT is still the second-most popular sandwich in the United States (the simple ham sandwich is first).
<br>
<br>
	The BLT, (Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato sandwich) became popular when fresh lettuce and tomatoes became available year round with the rapid expansion of supermarkets after World War II.
<br>
<br>
	A BLT is best when made at home, rather than ordered at a restaurant.
